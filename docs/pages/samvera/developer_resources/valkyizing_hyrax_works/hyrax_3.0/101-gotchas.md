### Roundtrip conversion changes attr's single value into a multi-value array

See [Issue #4556](https://github.com/samvera/hyrax/issues/4556) for more information.

### Changeset fails to save with Ldp:NotFound when adding 2nd of multiple child works one at a time

CAUSED BY: created parent work through valkyrie_create passing in the id for the parent.  

SOLUTION: When the id was removed and the factory generated the id, the error went away.  I did not explore deeper why this happens.  

Seems like you should be able to pass in the id.  

It works when...
* you apply the above solution
* you only add one child
* you add all children by passing in an array of member_ids
* you don't use changesets

### solr docs not an exact match

The solr documents generated by Valkyrie resource indexers do not exactly match those generated by ActiveFedora.

See [Issue #4487](https://github.com/samvera/hyrax/issues/4487) for more information.

### Can't display resource in Hyrax app after creating it

The new form displays and allows for setting field values.  It saves and appears to create all the structures needed in Fedora and Solr.  But when it forwards to the display page for the resource, it raises an exception.

See [Issue #4559](https://github.com/samvera/hyrax/issues/4559) for more information.
