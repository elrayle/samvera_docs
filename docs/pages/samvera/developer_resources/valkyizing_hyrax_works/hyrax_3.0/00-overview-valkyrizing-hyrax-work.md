## Purpose
    
The goal of this effort is to convert `ActiveFedora::Base` works to `Valkyrie::Resource` works to determine how well Hyrax code can function with Valkyrie works and identify areas that still need adjustment.

This is not a polished 'how to' guide.  This is a description of the process we followed to explore moving to Hyrax 3.0 using exclusively Valkyrie::Resource works, and later collections, filesets, and files.

<ul class='warning'><li>This is an anecdotal exploration of the process.  Code is improving regularly.  Some of the stumbling blocks may have been resolved.</li></ul>
